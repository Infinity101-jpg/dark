# Dark
The Dark Programming Language (runs off of Python).

All of your code runs in the "main.dark" file. Do not edit the "main.py" file. Also, do not edit the "o.py" file. These files make the Programming Language work, so do not edit them. Note: variable name cannot be "pass" use "passw" instead.

# How To Write Your First Program
Below is a simple "Hello World" program.

def main():
	write('Hello, World!')
		
run()

As you can see, the Dark Programming Language is a very simple language.

# How To Make A Loop
Below is a simple loop.

def main():
	i = 1
	while i <= 10:
		print(i)
		i = i + 1

run()

# Data Types
Below is all The data types.

int:
a = 10

float:
b = 2.4

str:
c = "Hello, World!"

boolean:
d = true
e = false

*Note when writing a boolean, everything is in lowercase letters.

# How to check what the type of something is

def main():
	a = 10
	write(typeof(a))

run()

/or/

def main():
	write(typeof("Hello"))

run()

/or/

def main():
	write(typeof(true))

run()

/or/

def main():
	write(typeof(1.5))

run()

# If/Else Statements

def main():
	a = 'hello'
	if a == 'hello':
		write('hi');
	else:
		write('oops');

run()

# How To Check For Type

def main():
	write(typeof("Hello"))
